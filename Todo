1. If we write to a file, we shouldn't need to have the whole file in memory, we can load and write simultaneously
2. Add tests for overwrite behaviour, if writing to file
3. Add integration tests
4. Drag over executable?
5. Piping? Generate a file.
6. Get as a binary to make commands nicer than java -jar
